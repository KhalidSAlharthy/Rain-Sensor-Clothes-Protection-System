# Rain-Sensor-Clothes-Protection-System
This Arduino-based project detects rainfall using a rain sensor and automatically pulls in hanging clothes using a servo motor. It is designed to prevent clothes from getting wet when it rains.

# Working Principle
The rain sensor detects the presence of rain by sensing water droplets. When rain is detected, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino. The Arduino then triggers the servo motor, which moves the clothes to a covered area to protect them from getting wet, Once the rain stops, the system can return the clothes to their original drying position.

# Components Used

| Component                      | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arduino Uno**                | Main microcontroller that reads sensor data and controls the servo motor. |
| **Rain Sensor Module**         | Detects rain through conductive pads and sends a signal to the Arduino.   |
| **Servo Motor (SG90)**         | Rotates to move the clothesline when rain is detected.                    |
| **Jumper Wires**               | Connect all the components electrically to the Arduino.                   |
| **9V Battery**                 | Provides portable power to the Arduino and other components.              |
| **Cardboard House Model**      | Simulated house used as a visual prototype for mounting components.       |
| **Clothesline + Mini Clothes** | Represents hanging clothes that are automatically pulled inside.          |
| **Baseboard (Black Platform)** | A sturdy surface to mount the house and components.                       |

| Rain is detected by the sensor, triggering the servo motor to pull the clothesline inside the coverd area to protect the clothes.                     |                           |


# Future Improvements
- Integrate WiFi module (ESP8266) to send rain alerts via smartphone.
- Add manual override button to control clothesline manually.
